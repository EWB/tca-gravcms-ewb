        title: Victoria
        quote: 'Sometimes, I felt like I lost confidence and my advantages. Fortunately, I met Tedra Cobb and had her ELS class the whole summer before [the] MBA program started. In her class, we were not only learning languages, but also American culture, and the American logic to communicate. After several months, my English and communication skills improved dramatically. I felt I was ready and confident for the MBA challenges. During the whole learning process, I had upset moments when it was hard to understand lots of idioms and slang. And every time, Tedra cheered me up and encouraged me a lot. For me, Tedra is not only a language teacher, but a mentor in my life.'

        quote: 'Moving is always a great and exciting challenge but when you change the nation you also must consider the new language.		Here in Potsdam there are few opportunities to learn English despite two universities which is why I really want to thank Tedra for her English class. Tedra is a friendly, funny and never boring teacher! I really appreciate her corrections during our speaking sessions about grammar and pronunciation. Moreover, the ESL class allowed me to meet new people and to better insert myself in the new context.  I guess these are the two main goals of Tedra: teach English and connect people.
